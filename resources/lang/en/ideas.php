        <b> Idea generation, categorization, prioritization, and implementation are the goals of the PIS system. </b>
        <br> <br>
        - Ideas are moderated before being published in the system. When an idea is published -
        the author
        receives a confirmation of activation by mail. In addition, the author receives notifications to the mailbox,
        if
        the idea was not accepted for publication (indicating the reason) and if its status was changed. <br> <br>
        - Ideas have 3 statuses - “active” (one might say, is under consideration), “paused” (ideas,
        which can
        be included in the implementation plan in the near future, but for now, work on their possible implementation
        suspended) and “implemented” (the idea was implemented). <br> <br>
        - The form for adding an idea (<a href=":route_add_idea">:route_add_idea</a>) has certain fields for
        classifications that
        allows you to do more precise processing of offers: <br> <br>
        <ul class = "without-list-style">
            <li>
                <b> Core competency </b> - a list of company competencies in the drop-down list. To
                developing
                we also include design, and sales as marketing. Accordingly, we relate the idea to
                relevant
                competencies or choose “other”
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Operational Goal </b> is the company\'s current operational goals. They can also
                look at wiki
                -> Vision and goals -> Operational goals
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Strategic objective </b> - these are the current strategic objectives of Ikantem. They can
                also
                look at Wiki -> Vision and goals -> Strategic tasks
            </li>
            <li> <b> Department </b> - which department the idea belongs to </li>
            <li> <b> Type </b> - the essence of the proposal affects the activities of the company as a whole or an individual
                department?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        You can select multiple competencies, goals, tasks, or departments (using CTRL).
        Do not worry about the correct selection of the above fields, as the idea will be
        undergo moderation and, if necessary, the categories will be corrected.
        <hr>
        Important ideas for implementing operational goals and strategic objectives fall into <strong> Priority Boards </strong>
        (task
        selection assigned to managers and department heads) and are accompanied by explanatory
        note. <br>
        An explanatory note is an analysis of the impact of an idea on stakeholders (customers,
        employees,
        partners, owners - who will be affected and what the expected result is), the value of the idea (ROI),
        conformity
        long-term goals of the company.
