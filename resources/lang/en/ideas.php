        <b> Idea generation, categorization, prioritization, and implementation ARE the goals of the PIS system. 
        Ideas generally fall into THREE CATEGORIES:<br><br>
        - Related to work conditions (office improvements, etc)<br>
        - Related to business processes/ flows. <br>
        - Related to product development. <br><br>
        </b>
        - Ideas are moderated (usually, on a weekly basis) before being published in the system. When an idea is 
        published - the submitter receives an activation confirmation e-mail. In addition, the submitter receives
         notifications to the mailbox, if the idea was not accepted for publication (indicating the reason) and if 
         its status was changed. <br> <br>
        - Ideas are assigned to the owner. Together with the idea submitter they can/ should communicate discussing 
        possible implementation solutions.  <br> <br>
        - The owner prioritizes ideas assigned to him to implement at his own discretion  <br> <br>
        - Ideas have 4 statuses - “active” (one might say, is under consideration), “paused” (ideas, which can be 
        included in the implementation plan in the future, but for now, work on their possible implementation 
        suspended), “completed” (the idea was implemented) and “rejected” (with the reason explained) <br> <br>

        - <a href=":route_add_idea">Idea submission form</a> has certain fields that allow you to do more precise 
        processing of initiatives: <br> <br>
        <ul class = "without-list-style">
            <li>
                <b> Core competency </b> - a list of company competencies in the drop-down list. To
                developing
                we also include design, and sales as marketing. Accordingly, we relate the idea to
                relevant
                competencies or choose “other”
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Operational Goal </b> is the company\'s current operational goals. They can also
                look at wiki
                -> Vision and goals -> Operational goals
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Strategic objective </b> - these are the current strategic objectives of Velmie. They can
                also
                look at Wiki -> Vision and goals -> Strategic tasks
            </li>
            <li> <b> Department </b> - which department the idea belongs to </li>
            <li> <b> Type </b> - the essence of the proposal affects the activities of the company as a whole or an individual
                department?
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        You can select multiple competencies, goals, tasks, or departments (using CTRL).
        <b>Do not worry about the correct selection of the above fields</b>, as the idea will be
        undergo moderation and, if necessary, the categories will be corrected.
        <hr>
        Important ideas for implementing operational goals and strategic objectives fall into <strong> Priority Boards </strong>
        (task
        selection assigned to managers and department heads) and are accompanied by explanatory
        note. <br>
        An explanatory note is an analysis of the impact of an idea on stakeholders (customers,
        employees,
        partners, owners - who will be affected and what the expected result is), the value of the idea (ROI),
        conformity
        long-term goals of the company.
